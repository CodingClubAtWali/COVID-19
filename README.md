# COVID-19 Smart Scraper

## Overview
The COVID-19 Smart Scraper is a tool that is developed by the members of the Wali Ul Asr Learning Institute Coding Club! This tool scrapes statistical information related to COVID-19 such as the total cases, deaths, cured, amount in critical / mild condition worldwide and for individual countries. Our tool monitors the statistics of over 220 countires at 10 minute intervals. All the information is stored in a secure database (MongoDB). The information is coneveyd by SMS and Email. We also took this project one step forward by making it a chatbot to go along with the sms delviery. When a user messages the phone number (+1 647-360-6629) with a country name, it will respond with the following information about the country:
    
    - Total Cases
    - Total Deaths
    - Total Recovered
    - Active Cases
    - Serious/Critical Condition
    - New Cases
    - New Deaths
    - Total Tests
    - Population
